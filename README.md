# Fluke-9010A-Pod-Adapters

Some quality of life improvements for Fluke 9010A Reproduction Pod users:

Fluke Pod adapter: use a standard DB 25 cable with your repro pod. Should work with the 'small' pods like Z80 and 6502. For Z80 you will need to use a low footprint crystal for the adapter to fit.

Fluke Pod adapter large: use a standard DB 25 cable with your repro pod. Should work with the 'large' pods like 6809 and 68000.

Z80 Pod 2x40 Pin Cable: Use a double 40pin ribbon cable to get better signal quality / more stable interfacing even with longer cables.

If you don't know what all this means, you probably won't need any of it..;)

Have fun
